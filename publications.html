									<h3>2016 Publications</h3>
									<h4><a href="publications/BioRob2016.html">BioRob</a></h4>
										<p>Partial-hand amputees are often able to use their wrist when performing daily
											activities, but this wrist movement can interfere with electromyogram (EMG) pattern
											recognition of functional hand-grasps while controlling myoelectric prostheses. These
											grasp patterns also commonly require activation of similar muscle sets, resulting in
											poor discrimination and more frequent misclassification. In our recent work, we developed
											a classifier training paradigm and control system that improves real-time control of a
											virtual prosthesis capable of selecting between 4 grasps in multiple wrist positions.
											However, it is unclear if there were adverse effects associated with operating the virtual
											prosthesis in certain wrist positions or with attempting to select specific grasps. The
											primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the required wrist position or grasp
											affected task timeout rates, and to determine the number of grasp selection attempts for
											both a baseline pattern recognition controller and our proposed controller. We show that
											the specific wrist position of a given task does not significantly affect performance for
											either the baseline controller (p>0.575) or the proposed controller (p>0.459). However,
											while the grasp required for a task significantly affects a user's ability to complete the
											task when using the baseline controller (p<0.05), this is not the case with the proposed
											controllers (p>0.429). Thus, subjects using the proposed controllers were more easily able
											to complete tasks involving grasps difficult to select with the baseline controller.</p>
									<h4><a href="publications/Frontiers2016.html">Frontiers in Neuroscience</a></h4>
										<p>Although partial-hand amputees largely retain the ability to use their wrist,
											it is difficult to preserve wrist motion while using a myoelectric partial-hand
											prosthesis without severely impacting control performance. Electromyogram (EMG)
											pattern recognition is a well-studied control method; however, EMG from wrist motion
											can obscure myoelectric finger control signals. Thus, to accommodate wrist motion and
											to provide high classification accuracy and minimize system latency, we developed a
											training protocol and a classifier that switches between long and short EMG analysis
											window lengths. Seventeen non-amputee and two partial-hand amputee subjects
											participated in a study to determine the effects of including EMG from different arm and
											hand locations during static and/or dynamic wrist motion in the classifier training data.
											We evaluated several real-time classification techniques to determine which control scheme
											yielded the highest performance in virtual real-time tasks using a three-way ANOVA. We
											found significant interaction between analysis window length and the number of grasps
											available. Including static and dynamic wrist motion and intrinsic hand muscle EMG with
											extrinsic muscle EMG significantly reduced pattern recognition classification error by 35%.
											Classification delay or majority voting techniques significantly improved real-time task
											completion rates (17%), selection (23%), and completion (11%) times, and selection attempts
											(15%) for non-amputee subjects, and the dual window classifier significantly reduced the
											time (8%) and average number of attempts required to complete grasp selections (14%) made
											in various wrist positions. Amputee subjects demonstrated improved task timeout rates, and
											made fewer grasp selection attempts, with classification delay or majority voting
											techniques. Thus, the proposed techniques show promise for improving control of partial-hand
											prostheses and more effectively restoring function to individuals using these devices.</p>
										
									<h3>2014 Publications</h3>
									<h4><a href="publications/EMBC2014.html">EMBC</a></h4>
										<p>Partial-hand amputees often retain good residual wrist motion, which is essential
											for functional activities involving use of the hand. Thus, a crucial design criterion
											for a myoelectric, partial-hand prosthesis control scheme is that it allows the user to
											retain residual wrist motion. Pattern recognition (PR) of electromyographic (EMG)
											signals is a well-studied method of controlling myoelectric prostheses. However, wrist
											motion degrades a PR system's ability to correctly predict hand-grasp patterns. We
											studied the effects of (1) window length and number of hand-grasps, (2) static and
											dynamic wrist motion, and (3) EMG muscle source on the ability of a PR-based control
											scheme to classify functional hand-grasp patterns. Our results show that training PR
											classifiers with both extrinsic and intrinsic muscle EMG yields a lower error rate than
											training with either group by itself (p<0.001); and that training in only variable
											wrist positions, with only dynamic wrist movements, or with both variable wrist
											positions and movements results in lower error rates than training in only the
											neutral wrist position (p<0.001). Finally, our results show that both an increase in
											window length and a decrease in the number of grasps available to the classifier
											significantly decrease classification error (p<0.001). These results remained consistent
											whether the classifier selected or maintained a hand-grasp.</p>
