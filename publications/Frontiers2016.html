										<h4>Abstract</h4>
										<p>Although partial-hand amputees largely retain the ability to use their wrist,
										it is difficult to preserve wrist motion while using a myoelectric partial-hand
										prosthesis without severely impacting control performance. Electromyogram (EMG)
										pattern recognition is a well-studied control method; however, EMG from wrist motion
										can obscure myoelectric finger control signals. Thus, to accommodate wrist motion and
										to provide high classification accuracy and minimize system latency, we developed a
										training protocol and a classifier that switches between long and short EMG analysis
										window lengths. Seventeen non-amputee and two partial-hand amputee subjects
										participated in a study to determine the effects of including EMG from different arm and
										hand locations during static and/or dynamic wrist motion in the classifier training data.
										We evaluated several real-time classification techniques to determine which control scheme
										yielded the highest performance in virtual real-time tasks using a three-way ANOVA. We
										found significant interaction between analysis window length and the number of grasps
										available. Including static and dynamic wrist motion and intrinsic hand muscle EMG with
										extrinsic muscle EMG significantly reduced pattern recognition classification error by 35%.
										Classification delay or majority voting techniques significantly improved real-time task
										completion rates (17%), selection (23%), and completion (11%) times, and selection attempts
										(15%) for non-amputee subjects, and the dual window classifier significantly reduced the
										time (8%) and average number of attempts required to complete grasp selections (14%) made
										in various wrist positions. Amputee subjects demonstrated improved task timeout rates, and
										made fewer grasp selection attempts, with classification delay or majority voting
										techniques. Thus, the proposed techniques show promise for improving control of partial-hand
										prostheses and more effectively restoring function to individuals using these devices.</p>
