													<p>I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University in the department of Biomedical Engineering, 
													and a graduate student researcher at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago's Center for Bionic Medicine.</p>
													
													<p>My research focuses on merging two separate fields of study:<br>
													<b>control of robotic prosthetic hands</b><br>
													and<br>
													<b>motor learning and adaptation</b></p>
													<p></p>

													<h3>Graduate Study</h3>
													<p>I started at Northwestern in 2012, and began my work at the Center for Bionic Medicine in January of 2013.
													My research typically focuses on how to control a prosthetic device, rather than the design of th device itself.
													In my opinion, if you have an incredibly-advanced prosthesis, but can't control it, it becomes little more than
													an expensive toy.</p>

													<p>I participate in several student organizations at Northwestern. From 2014-2016, I served as the president of
													<a href="http://sites.northwestern.edu/bmegs">Biomedical Engineering Graduate Students (BMEGS)</a>, which is responsible
													for planning social and academic events throughout the year. I also serve on the
													<a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/graduate-leadership-council/">McCormick Graduate Leadership Council (MGLC),</a>
													where I organize workshops on transferable skills for the graduate student population.</p>
													
													<p>Finally, I've recently taken to the art of science communication. I participated in the first
													<a href="http://comscicon.com/">Chicago Communicating Science Conference (ComSciCon-Chicago)</a> in the summer of
													2015, and became an organizer starting with the second conference in 2016.</p>
													
													<h3>Undergraduate Study</h3>
													<p>I studied Engineering, with a Mechanical specialty, at the Colorado School of Mines from 2008-2012. In addition
													to the univertisty's multidisciplinary focus, I also participated extensively in the Robotics Club, which served to
													start my interest in robotics and eventually prompt my graduate studies. My senior design project at Mines was to
													outfit and control a standing wheelchair using EEG signals from a commercially-available EEG headset. While the end
													result may not have worked exactly as desired, it did also serve to prime my graduate studies with medical devices.</p>
